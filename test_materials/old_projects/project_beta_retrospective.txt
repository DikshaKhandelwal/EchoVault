a working solution. This retrospective documents what went wrong
and how we can improve future projects.

CHALLENGES FACED

5. Timeline delays - Delivered 3 weeks late

BUDGET IMPACT

Final Cost: $245,000
Overrun: $45,000 (22.5%)

WHAT WENT WRONG
---------------
- Insufficient initial planning
- Unclear requirements from stakeholder
- Lack of buffer time for contingencies
- Poor communication with third-party vendor
- Technical architecture decisions made too quickly

WHAT WENT RIGHT

- Team stayed motivated despite setbacks
- Client remained supportive throughout delays
- Final product quality exceeded expectations

- No major bugs reported in first month

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE
---------------------------
1. More thorough requirement gathering phase
